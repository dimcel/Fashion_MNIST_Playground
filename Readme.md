# MNIST Image Classification with Popular Classifiers

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the use of popular machine learning classifiers to classify the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset is widely used as a benchmark in the field of machine learning, making it an excellent starting point for exploring various classifiers.

## Classifiers Used

The following classifiers are implemented and compared in this repository:

1. **Logistic Regression:** A linear classifier that is simple yet effective.
   
2. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):** A non-parametric method based on the similarity of data points.

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A powerful classifier that works well for both linear and non-linear data.

4. **Varius Ensemblers:** Ensemble learning method that builds a multitude of decision trees.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). It is a classic dataset for introducing image classification concepts.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Instructions in Each Notebook

Each notebook contains detailed instructions and explanations for the following steps:

- Loading and Preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
- Implementing and training the respective classifier.
- Evaluating the model's performance.
- Fine-tuning and optimizing parameters (where applicable).

## Results and Discussion

The results and comparative analysis of each classifier are provided in the notebooks. Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters, preprocessing techniques, or even explore additional classifiers.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a practical guide for implementing and comparing various classifiers on the MNIST dataset. This project offers a hands-on experience with popular models.
